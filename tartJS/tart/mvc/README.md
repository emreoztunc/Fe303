# tart.mvc
Tart MVC framework is a classical web MVC framework for Javascript. The framework is based upon Google Closure Library so it plays very well with Google Closure Compiler.

# Idea
Tart MVC framework is a micro-framework in that it only provides core MVC functionality without infringing any implementation details, which means, as a developer, you are free to choose your own way of development; therefore there are no such convenient methods as Model.find, etc. The library's main concern is performance, so every care is taken for performance to be bulletproof.
